# Solution Overview:

To solve this scenario, we can design a simple system for managing customers' Cushon ISA investments. Here's a basic solution:

# 1. Tech Stack:

User Interface: Create a user interface that allows customers to perform the following actions:

Select a single fund for investment.

Input the amount they want to invest.

Submit the investment request.

# 2. Future Enhancements (Not Covered in the Solution):

Set up a database to store customer investment information. The table can include the following fields: Customer Name, Customer Address, Selected Fund, Investment Amount, Investment Date

Query Functionality: Add a query function that allows customers to view their investment information at any time. Customers can use their customer ID or other authentication information to perform queries.

Automatic Investment Strategies: Allow customers to set up automated periodic investments, not just one-time investments.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
